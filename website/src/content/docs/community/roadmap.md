# Roadmap

Speck is actively evolving. This page outlines what we're working on, what's planned, and how you can help shape the future of specification-driven development.

---

## Current Focus

**Hook System & Performance** (In Progress)
- PrePromptSubmit hook for automatic prerequisite validation
- Context pre-loading for faster command execution
- Sub-100ms hook latency target

**Worktree Integration** (Beta)
- Automatic worktree creation for each feature
- IDE auto-launch with session handoff
- Dependency auto-installation

---

## Planned Enhancements

### Near Term

- **Speck CLI** - Standalone CLI for use outside Claude Code
- **Task Dependencies** - Automatic dependency ordering in tasks.md
- **Progress Tracking** - Visual progress indicators for multi-step implementations

### Medium Term

- **GitHub Integration** - Convert tasks to GitHub Issues automatically
- **Team Collaboration** - Shared spec libraries and team constitutions
- **IDE Extensions** - VS Code extension for spec visualization

### Longer Term

- **AI-Assisted Reviews** - Automated spec quality checks
- **Template Marketplace** - Community-contributed spec templates
- **Analytics Dashboard** - Track specification-to-implementation metrics

---

## Under Consideration

Ideas we're evaluating based on community feedback:

- **Multi-language Support** - Constitutions in different programming paradigms
- **CI/CD Integration** - Spec validation in build pipelines
- **Conflict Resolution** - Better handling of spec conflicts in multi-repo
- **Versioned Specs** - Track spec evolution over time
