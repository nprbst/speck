# Implementation Plan: Stacked PR Support

**Feature Branch**: `008-stacked-pr-support`
**Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Status**: In Progress
**Created**: 2025-11-18

---

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of stacked PR support for Speck, enabling developers to break large features into multiple reviewable branches with explicit dependency tracking. The feature supports tool-agnostic workflows (Graphite, GitHub Stack, manual git), freeform branch naming, and automated stacking during `/speck.implement` based on user story boundaries.

**Core Value**: Reduce friction in stacked PR workflows by providing centralized branch metadata, branch-aware task generation, and intelligent automation that detects natural boundaries for creating new branches.

**Workflow Mode**: Stacked (this feature implements stacked PR support)

---

## Technical Context

### Architecture Integration

- **Existing Components**:
  - Branch detection: `.speck/scripts/common/paths.ts` (getCurrentBranch, checkFeatureBranch, findFeatureDirByPrefix)
  - Task generation: `.claude/commands/speck.tasks.md` (Claude AI-driven) + `.speck/templates/tasks-template.md`
  - Environment display: `.claude/commands/speck.env.md` (7 existing sections)
  - TypeScript 5.3+ with Bun 1.0+ runtime (from constitution)
  - Bun Shell API for filesystem operations
  - Git 2.30+ for branch management
  - Claude Code plugin system 2.0+ (slash commands, agents)
  - Path resolution utilities from 007-multi-repo-monorepo-support

- **New Components**:
  - `.speck/branches.json` schema and management
  - Branch stack commands (`/speck.branch create`, `/speck.branch list`, `/speck.branch status`, `/speck.branch import`)
  - Branch-aware task generation with `--branch` and `--stories` flags
  - Stacking detection and prompting in `/speck.implement`
  - Workflow mode tracking in plan.md metadata
  - GitHub CLI (`gh pr create`) integration

### Technology Choices

- **Runtime**: TypeScript 5.3+ with Bun 1.0+ (consistent with existing Speck stack)
- **Git Operations**: Bun Shell API for git command execution
- **PR Creation**: GitHub CLI (`gh`) with graceful fallback to manual instructions
- **Data Storage**: JSON file (`.speck/branches.json`) at repository root
- **Validation**: JSON schema validation for branch metadata
- **Command Interface**: Claude Code slash commands with YAML frontmatter

### Dependencies

- Git 2.30+ (existing requirement)
- Bun 1.0+ runtime (existing requirement)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) - optional, gracefully degrades if unavailable
- Existing Speck utilities:
  - Path resolution: `detectSpeckRoot()`, `getFeaturePaths()`, `findFeatureDirByPrefix()` from `.speck/scripts/common/paths.ts`
  - Spec detection: `getCurrentBranch()`, `checkFeatureBranch()` from `.speck/scripts/common/paths.ts`
  - Task template: `.speck/templates/tasks-template.md` (252-line Markdown structure)

### Integration Points

- **Modify**: `/speck.tasks` to support `--branch` and `--stories` flags
- **Modify**: `/speck.env` to display branch stack status
- **Modify**: `/speck.implement` to detect boundaries and prompt for stacking
- **Modify**: `/speck.plan` to support `--stacked` flag and workflow mode metadata
- **Create**: `/speck.branch` command family (create, list, status, import)
- **Extend**: Constitution to support `defaultWorkflowMode` setting

### Constraints

- Single-repo only (multi-repo stacking explicitly out of scope)
- Backwards compatibility required: existing single-branch workflows unchanged
- Tool-agnostic: must work with Graphite, GitHub Stack, and manual git
- No automatic GitHub API polling for PR status updates
- `.speck/branches.json` must be version-controlled (not gitignored)

## Constitution Check

### Relevant Principles

**Principle III - Specification-First Development**:  PASS
- Feature began with technology-agnostic specification
- All requirements testable without implementation details
- Success criteria measurable and user-focused

**Principle V - Claude Code Native**:  PASS
- All new commands implemented as slash commands (`/speck.branch.*`)
- Integration with existing Claude Code plugin system
- TypeScript CLI provides parity for non-Claude Code users

**Principle VI - Technology Agnosticism**:  PASS
- Spec contains zero framework/language mentions
- Tool-agnostic workflow (Graphite, GitHub Stack, manual)
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not implementation

**Principle VII - File Format Compatibility**: � NEEDS ATTENTION
- `.speck/branches.json` is Speck-specific metadata (stored outside `specs/`)
- Spec directory structure unchanged (`specs/008-stacked-pr-support/`)
- Branch naming allows freeform patterns, preserving `NNN-short-name` compatibility
- **Verification Required**: Ensure spec-kit users can read plan.md/tasks.md without issues

### Quality Gate Checklist

- [x] Mandatory spec sections complete (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)
- [x] Requirements testable and unambiguous (27 functional requirements defined)
- [x] Success criteria measurable (10 measurable outcomes with metrics)
- [x] Zero implementation details in spec (validated manually)
- [x] Edge cases documented (11 edge cases identified)
- [ ] Technical unknowns identified for research phase (5 NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers)

## Phase 0: Research & Discovery

### Unknowns to Resolve

1. **Current Branch Detection Mechanism**
   - Where: Codebase analysis
   - Question: How does Speck currently detect feature branch (NNN-short-name)?
   - Impact: Need to extend for freeform branch names and `.speck/branches.json` lookups
   - Research Task: Search for branch detection code in existing Speck scripts

2. **Task Generation Pipeline**
   - Where: Codebase analysis
   - Question: Where is task generation implemented and how are templates processed?
   - Impact: Must modify to support `--branch` and `--stories` filtering
   - Research Task: Find task generation entry point and template rendering logic

3. **Current `/speck.env` Implementation**
   - Where: Codebase analysis
   - Question: How is environment status currently displayed?
   - Impact: Need to add branch stack display without breaking existing output
   - Research Task: Locate `/speck.env` command implementation

4. **Path Resolution from Multi-Repo Support**
   - Where: 007-multi-repo-monorepo-support feature
   - Question: What utilities exist for spec/feature path resolution?
   - Impact: Reuse existing path utilities for branch-to-spec mapping
   - Research Task: Review specs/007-multi-repo-monorepo-support/plan.md and implementation

5. **Constitution Default Workflow Mode**
   - Where: Design decision
   - Question: Should constitution support `defaultWorkflowMode` setting now or later?
   - Impact: Defines priority of settings override (CLI flag > plan.md > constitution > default)
   - Research Task: Review constitution amendment process and existing patterns

### Research Deliverables

**Output**: `research.md` with sections:
- Branch Detection Mechanisms (current implementation + proposed extensions)
- Task Generation Architecture (pipeline overview + modification points)
- Environment Display Patterns (current `/speck.env` + stack status additions)
- Path Resolution Utilities (reusable functions from 007 feature)
- Workflow Mode Settings Hierarchy (decision on constitution setting timing)

1. **BranchStackEntry**
   - Fields: branchName (string), baseBranch (string), specId (string), prNumber (number | null), status (enum), createdAt (ISO timestamp), updatedAt (ISO timestamp)
   - Validation: branchName non-empty, baseBranch exists in git, specId references valid spec, status in [active, submitted, merged, abandoned]
   - Relationships: Many-to-one with Spec (via specId), Tree structure via baseBranch references

2. **BranchMappingFile** (`.speck/branches.json`)
   - Fields: schemaVersion (string), branches (BranchStackEntry[]), specIndex (Record<specId, branchName[]>)
   - Validation: JSON schema validation, no circular dependencies, all baseBranch references exist
   - Operations: Create, Read, Update entry, Rebuild index, Validate integrity

3. **WorkflowModeMetadata** (embedded in plan.md)
   - Fields: workflowMode ("single-branch" | "stacked"), userStoryGroupings (Record<groupName, usIds[]>), suggestedBoundaries (string[])

   - Output: Task execution with optional stacking prompts at US boundaries
   - Errors: Conflicting workflow mode settings

**JSON Schemas**:

File: `contracts/branch-mapping-schema.json`
```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["schemaVersion", "branches", "specIndex"],
  "properties": {
    "schemaVersion": {"type": "string", "pattern": "^1\\.0$"},
    "branches": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {"$ref": "#/definitions/BranchStackEntry"}
    },
    "specIndex": {
      "type": "object",
      "additionalProperties": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
    }
  },
  "definitions": {
    "BranchStackEntry": {
      "type": "object",
      "required": ["branchName", "baseBranch", "specId", "status", "createdAt", "updatedAt"],
      "properties": {
        "branchName": {"type": "string", "minLength": 1},
        "baseBranch": {"type": "string", "minLength": 1},
        "specId": {"type": "string", "pattern": "^\\d{3}-.+$"},
        "prNumber": {"type": ["number", "null"]},

        "updatedAt": {"type": "string", "format": "date-time"}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Quickstart Guide (`quickstart.md`)

**Target Audience**: Developers adopting stacked PR workflows with Speck

**30-Second Start**:
```bash
# Create first stacked branch
/speck.branch create "nprbst/db-layer" --base main

# Generate branch-specific tasks
/speck.tasks --branch nprbst/db-layer --stories US1,US2

# Implement with automatic stacking prompts
/speck.implement --stacked
```

**Common Workflows**:
1. Creating a branch stack from scratch
2. Importing existing git branches into Speck metadata
3. Generating tasks for specific branch scope
4. Viewing stack status and dependencies
5. Creating PRs during implementation

**Troubleshooting**:
- Circular dependency errors
- Malformed branches.json recovery
- Missing `gh` CLI fallback

---

## Phase 2: Task Planning

*Note: Phase 2 (task breakdown) is deferred to `/speck.tasks` execution after Phase 1 completion.*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Group by command family (`/speck.branch.*`, `/speck.tasks`, `/speck.implement`, `/speck.env`)
- Prioritize backwards compatibility (single-branch mode) first
- Implement core branch management before automation features
- Test stacking detection and prompting separately from PR creation

**Estimated Task Count**: 40-50 tasks across 7 user stories
