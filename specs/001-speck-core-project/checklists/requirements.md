# Specification Quality Checklist: Speck - Claude Code-Native Spec-Driven Development

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding
to planning **Created**: 2025-11-14 **Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is ready for
`/speckit.plan`.

**Validation Summary**:

- 5 user stories defined with priorities (P1, P2, P3)
- 26 functional requirements organized by category
- 10 measurable success criteria
- 6 edge cases identified
- 8 key entities defined
- All sections complete with no implementation details
- No clarification markers present (specification is clear and comprehensive)
